# Analytics project developer simulation

Experience the end-to-end collaborative process of developing code that’s production-ready

## TODO

- come up with project theme
- prioritize exercises
- what's technical architecture look like?
- what's the process look like?

## Overview

- picture of process
- picture of architecture they'll work with
- org structure of ppl they'll interact with  (e.g., scrum master, infrastructure, engineering manager, etc.)

Principles:
- keep it simple
- buy/copy vs build (let's not reinvent the wheel)
- outsource where needed (e.g., ask a scrum master if they have good estimation exercise instead of creating yourself)
- automate the complex things so we can focus on the basics (e.g., use Docker to provision a lot of the DevOps pipeline so participants don't have to do that)
- minimize dependencies

Design constraints:
- javascript and python only
- analytics product development (not ad-hoc analytics project)


## Learning Objectives

- basic setup of a development environment
- familiarity with production-level analytipcs software product development workflow, tools, and collaboration

Skills we'll touch on:
- software development
- solution architecture
- infrastructure
- DevOps
- collaboration

include some way to get folks without formal CS background up to speed on technical terms (e.g., CI/CD)
Include some overview of the other roles a developer might work with
how to setup dev environment
work through planning parts of a change
dev side of breaking down a story
estimation
develop change / production-level software development workflow and collaboration
Develop data flow/app architecture
Write pseudocode
Write code
have to debug it locally
